                    <h1><b>Music</b></h1>
                    <p>
                        One of my main interests is music, mainly of the western
                        classical genre. I am also part of my school symphonic
                        band program, and play the bass clarinet. I was also
                        part of the 2024-2025 GMEA All-State band as an
                        alternate. Some of my favorite pieces include Crusell's
                        second clarinet concerto, and I also like Mendelssohn's
                        violin concerto in E minor.

                    <h1><b>Cubing</b></h1>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy cubing as a passtime, and can solve most
                        main-stream cube puzzles. My fastest time on a 3x3 cube
                        is 12.80 seconds, and 1.68 for a 2x2 cube. I use a MoYu
                        RS3 M 2020 as my 3x3.
